## Done!

* Download or host jQuery (minified) & include in my HTML. -- DONE
* programmatically ensure that user cannot input grid dimensions larger than a maximum X (decide) -- DONE
* check if `<input>` tag can handle it, if not --> programmatically ensure that user cannot input grid dimensions less than a minimum 1 -- DONE
* add a feature that somehow highlights a cell when it is hovered over -- DONE
* add functionality that allows user to undo the coloring of a cell by clicking on it again, AND adding a new color over an old one? -- DONE
* Should designs.js really be implemented in the `<body>` tag? What about using some JavaScript '.ready' functionalities? -- Done: document ready handler registered by passing my function into jQuery.
* Should the script be moved to the `<head>`? What is the convention? -- Answer: It depends, but typically stylesheets should be included in the `<head>` and and scripts at the bottom before the closing `</body>` tag.
* provide a "clear canvas" button -- DONE
* add a placeholder of some sort to the design canvas section that initializes before any user input? (initialize it as a 10x10 grid --> add some colored cells) -- DONE

* document lessons learned -- DONE
* single quotes, in JS file -- DONE
